            <h1>How to solve a conditional probability problem</h1>
            <p>Today, I will be showing you guys how to solve a simple conditional probablility problem.</p>

            <h2>Our problem</h2>

            <p>There are <b>1,000 students</b> in a school. <b>300 students</b> are enrolled in a calculus course and <b>250
                students</b> are enrolled in a biology course. There are <b>70 students</b> who are taking <b>both</b>
                calculus and biology.
                If a student is chosen at random, (a) What is the probability that the student is taking calculus?
                (b) What is the probability that the student is taking calculus <b>given</b> that the student is also taking
                biology? (c) What is the probability that the student is taking biology <b>given</b> that the student is also
                taking calculus?</p>
        </div>

        <!-- How to approach this problem -->
        <div class="first-step">
            <h2>What to do first</h2>

            <p>The first thing to note is that this problem has multiple parts (a, b, and c). We will start off by
                solving part (a) but before that, you should take note of some important details (i.e, number of students in
                each course). I put all important details in bold. <br>
                Another thing that would aid us in solving this problem is visualization. For example, a <b>venn diagram</b>
                would help us visualize this problem. It is also commonly use in conditional probability problems.</p>

            <!-- image insert of venn diagram -->
            <div class="venn-diagram">
                <h3>Here is our venn diagram</h3>
                <img src="Images/VD.jpg" alt="Venn Diagram" width="350" height="350">
            </div>

            <p>As you can see, the venn diagram makes the problem clearer. There are two circles (called sets) labeled <b>A</b>
                and <b>B</b> in a rectangle labeled <b>S</b>. Both A and B are called <b>events</b>.
                Event <b>A</b> represents the number of students taking calculus while event <b>B</b> represents the
                number of students taking biology. You can see the amount in each respective circle.
                The <b>intersection</b> of A and B shows the number of students taking both calculus and biology.
                An intersection represents what two events have in common.
                It's the overlap of A and B. <b>S</b> is called the <b>sample space</b> or the <b>universal set</b>. The
                universal set contains all elements or represents all possible outcomes. In this case, S includes all students
                in the school.</p>
            
            <div class="table-container">
                <p><br> Alternatively, we can also make a small table to help us:</p>

                <!-- This a table -->
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Students taking calculus</th>
                        <th>Students taking biology</th>
                        <th>Students taking calculus and biology</th>
                        <th>Total # of students</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>300</td>
                        <td>250</td>
                        <td>70</td>
                        <td>1000</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </div>

        </div>

        <!-- This is the solution to part (a) -->
        <div class="part-a">
            <h2>Solving part (a)</h2>
            <p>Part (a) states: What is the probability that the student is taking calculus?</p>

            <p>This part is fairly simple. To find the probability of a student taking calculus, you would take the number
                of students taking calculus (300) and divide it by the total number of students (1,000). Another way to look at
                this is: We divide event (A) by the universal set (S).</p> 
            
            <div class="a-solution">
                <p>Do that and we get the following</p>

                <img src="Images/part(a).jpg" alt="part a" width="600" height="150">

                <p>So, the probability of a student taking calculus is 0.3 or 30%.</p>
            </div>

        </div>
        <hr>

        <!-- This is the solution to part (b) -->
        <div class="part-b">
            <h2>Solving part (b)</h2>
            <p>Part (b) states: What is the probability that the student is taking calculus <b>given</b> that the student is
                also taking biology?</p>

            <p>Part (b) is a little bit harder than (a) but if you know the right formula to use, then it's fairly simple.
                Before I give you the formula, let's look at this question in another way. <br> What is the probability of event
                A (number of students taking calculus) occurring <b>given</b> that event B (number of students taking biology) has
                already occurred?<br> The way to write this as an equation is: <b>P(A | B)</b> <br> This is the first part of
                the formula to solve this problem. What about the rest?</p>

            <div class="b-formula">
                <p>The formula for conditional probability looks like this:</p>
                <img src="Images/formula.jpg" alt="formula" width="600" height="150">
            </div>

            <p>The probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred is equal to the probability of the
                event A intersect event B divided by the probability of event B. Event B must also be greater than 0.</p>

            <p>An important detail to keep in mind is that we already know B has occurred since it was given to us. This means
                that everything outside of the set B can be discarded. We will only focus on the set B. You can refer to the
                venn diagram for visualization. Now, this means that the outcome of A can only be possible if it is within the set A
                intersect B. Or, the overlap of A and B (refer to the venn diagram).</p>

            <div class="b-solution">
                <p>Now, let's use the formula and see what we get:</p>
                <p>(Note: the intersect symbol looks like an upside down capital U.)</p>
                <img src="Images/part(b).jpg" alt="part b" width="600" height="150">

                <p>So, the probability that the student is taking calculus given that the student is also taking biology is 0.28 or
                    28%.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <hr>

        <!-- This is the solution to part (c) -->
        <div class="part-c">
            <h2>Solving part (c)</h2>
            <p>Part (c) states: What is the probability that the student is taking biology <b>given</b> that the student is also
                taking calculus?</p>

            <p>Part (c) is similar to part (b). You would use the same formula in the previous part to solve this one. However,
                the order is going to be different. <br> This problem asks us: What is the probability of event B <b>given</b>
                that event A has already occurred. The equation would look like this now: <b>P(B | A)</b> </p>
            
            <div class="c-solution">
                <p>Let's use the rest of the formula and see what we get:</p>

                <img src="Images/part(c).jpg" alt="part c" width="600" height="150">
                <p>So, the probability that the student is taking biology given that the student is also taking calculus is around
                    0.23 or 23.3%.</p>
            </div>

            <p>You should have notice that because A was given to us in this problem, we only focus on the set A and discard
                anything outside of A. This means that the outcome of B can olny be possible if it is within the set B intersect
                A. This is why for the formula, we did the probability of event B intersect event A divided by the probability of event
                A.</p>
        </div>
